# Instructor notes

The test code is fairly long and exhaustive.
However the amount of code needed to make the tests pass
is less then half the amount of code in the tests.

The tests are exhaustive and specific to be rigid.
The idea being that by following the tests you should
be guided along the path to writing classes and methods
that will result in the same public interface across
all implementations.

Let me start you off with a hint. When you first run RSpec
you'll get an error that you cannot load a file called
'battle_bot'. That `lib/` folder seems pretty empty
and lonely. Why don't you give it a few class files to
keep it company? See if that gets things rolling!

Enjoy and good luck!
